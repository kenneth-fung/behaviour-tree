# Behaviour Tree

This is a behaviour tree written for Unity in C#.
It is based on this [article](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ChrisSimpson/20140717/221339/Behavior_trees_for_AI_How_they_work.php) by Chris Simpson.
The tree was originally written as part of another project,
and it is uploaded here now by itself so that it can be reused across projects.
